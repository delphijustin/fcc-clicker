# fcc-clicker
A script that keeps your freeconferencecall.com conference active even after 6 hours
<p>
  This script was created so I can stream my TV over the internet. I didn't like the
  6 hour limit so I wrote this script. setFCC.vbs file allows you to configure fcc-clicker
  modes(such as minimizing the window when done or disable noise reduction).
</p>
Examples of how to use controlFCC.vbs:
<p>
  Each mode is a letter or symbol passed to the command-line<br>
  For example to disable Noise reduction and minimize the window):<br>
  setFCC.vbs /modes:NH<p>
  </p>
<p>
  To see more on how to use controlFCC.vbs open the file with no parameters.
